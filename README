    Perl::Critic policy prereqs

VERSION

    Version 0.006

SYNOPSIS

      # in dist.ini:
      [AutoPrereqs::Perl::Critic]
      critic_config        = .perlcriticrc  ; defaults to not specify a profile
      phase                = develop        ; default
      type                 = requires       ; default
      remove_core_policies = 1              ; default

DESCRIPTION

    This plugin will add Perl::Critic and all policies used by it, in the
    installed version, as distribution prerequisites.

 critic_config

    By default no policy is specified which lets Perl::Critic find the
    config itself. This defaults to .perlcriticrc in the current directory.

 phase

    By default, the dependencies are added to the develop phase. This can
    be changed to every valid phase.

 remove_core_policies

    By default, policies that are included in the latest Perl::Critic
    distribution are not added as dependency. This can be changed by
    setting remove_core_policies to 0.

    Note: Perl::Critic itself is always added as dependency which will come
    with the core policies.

    Note: This feature needs HTTP access to cpanmetadb.plackperl.org.
    Please disable this feature if you're system cannot access that server.

    Note: To reduce network traffic and remove the delay caused by the
    network access the cache file .perlcritic_package.yml is generated. You
    can either add this file to your .gitignore file or add it to Git. It
    will be updated as soon as the system runs a newer version of
    Perl::Critic then the one that is mentioned in the cache file.

 type

    By default, the dependencies are added as type requires. This can be
    changed to every valid phase.
